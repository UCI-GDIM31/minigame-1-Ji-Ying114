## Devlog
Write your Devlog here.
The Scene in a game is simular to that in a drama. If a game is a play,  it can include at least one or multiple scenes in which certain stories take place. The GameObjects are like the actors in the Scene. They are the basic units that interact with each other. A GameObject includes multiple Coomponets; they are like the scripts of different aspects for each actor or actress that direct what the actors speak and how they act.
